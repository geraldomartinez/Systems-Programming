            A Sample Input for Part (a) of Program V
            ========================================

  The directory /home2/classes/csi402/public/prog5 contains
five hidden files (other than "." and "..").  When the command

        p5a  /home2/classes/csi402/public/prog5

is executed, the expected output (which your program must write to
stdout) is shown below: 

        .cshrc      2523  Apr 20 2012
        .login      1404  Apr 20 2012
        .plan        425  Feb 20 1998
        .viminfo    9549  Apr 18 2012
        .dtprofile  5232  Feb  7 2001

(Your program may print the above lines in any order.)

When the command

        p5a  /home2/classes/csi402/public/prog5   -s

is executed, the expected output (which your program must write to
stdout) is shown below. (Because of the "-s" flag, the output
must be in non-decreasing order of file size.)

        .plan        425  Feb 20 1998
        .login      1404  Apr 20 2012
        .cshrc      2523  Apr 20 2012
        .dtprofile  5232  Feb  7 2001
        .viminfo    9549  Apr 18 2012

Notes:
------

  (1) As shown above, your program should produce ONLY the
      information specified in the handout (i.e., the file name,
      its logical size and the date of last modification in the
      form "mmm dd yyyy"). Your program should NOT produce any
      other extraneous information. 

  (2) In the expected output shown above, the columns
      are aligned. Your program need not align the columns.

  (3) DON'T copy the hidden files in the above directory to your
      directory. Instead, run the p5a command directly as indicated
      above.

  (4) Be sure to test your program thoroughly by creating hidden files
      in some of your own directories.
