Information about sample inputs for Part (b) of Program V:
----------------------------------------------------------
  There are two sample inputs for Part (b). They are in the
subdirectories b_test1 and b_test2 respectively.

  (a) In the b_test1 subdirectory, the individual files 
      are cons.h, const.h, count.c, count.o and arch1. 
      The file arch1 is the archive obtained by running 
      the Unix command

         p5b -c arch1  cons.h  const.h  count.c  count.o 

  (b) In the b_test2 subdirectory, the individual files 
      are file1.c, file11.c, j1.c, j1.o and arch2. 
      The file arch2 is the archive obtained by running 
      the Unix command

         p5b -c arch2  file1.c  file11.c  j1.c  j1.o 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT!!
   Some of the files in the above directories (e.g. the two
archive files arch1 and arch2) are BINARY files. They were
created on itsunix. They may NOT be compatible with other 
machines. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Here, we explain how to use the test case in b_test1.  Similar 
comments apply to the test case in b_test2.

  As mentioned above, the directory b_test1 contains the files
cons.h, const.h, count.c, count.o and arch1. 

  With these files, when you run the command

      p5b  -c  new_arch  cons.h  const.h  count.c  count.o 

the binary file new_arch produced by your program should be
identical to the file arch1. (You should use the "diff" command
to compare the two files.)

   When you run the Unix command

      p5b  -p  cons  arch1

the output to stdout should be the following:

             cons.h     52
             const.h    89

When you run the command

      p5b  -p  cr  arch1

the output to stdout should be a message of the following form:

      No matching files found.

  To check whether your program extracts the files correctly from the
archive, you are advised to create a new directory (say, temp) containing
only the executable version (p5b) of your program and the file arch1.
In that directory, when you run the command

      p5b  -x  arch1

your program should create the files cons.h, const.h, count.c and count.o 
in the directory. These newly created files should be identical to
the respective files cons.h, const.h,  count.c and count.o 
in the other directory.  (Again, you should use "diff" to make sure 
that there are no differences between the corresponding files.)
