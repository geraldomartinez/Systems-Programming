Information about sample inputs for Program II:
===============================================

  There are two text files, namely t1.txt and t2.txt. The
corresponding binary files are t1.bin and t2.bin respectively.

I. Testing your program with -t and -b flags:
---------------------------------------------

  We will explain how to use the first test case (t1.txt and
t1.bin) with flags -t and -b. Similar comments apply to the 
second test case. 

(a) Testing the program with the -t flag:
-----------------------------------------

  When you execute the Unix command 

         p2  -t  t1.txt  new_t1.bin

the (binary) file new_t1.bin produced by your program should be IDENTICAL
to the file t1.bin in this directory. To check whether the binary files
new_t1.bin and t1.bin are identical, you should use the following 
Unix command:

       diff  t1.bin  new_t1.bin

If the files are different, the above command will produce
a message to that effect. If the files are identical, you won't
see any output; the Unix system will simply produce 
the prompt for the next command. 

(b) Testing the program with the -b flag:
-----------------------------------------

  When you execute the Unix command 

         p2  -b  t1.bin  new_t1.txt

the (text) file new_t1.txt produced by your program should be IDENTICAL
to the file t1.txt in this directory. To check whether the text files
new_t1.bin and t1.bin are identical, you should again use the 
Unix diff command as follows. (Note that when you compare two
text files, the -q flag is used to ensure that diff produces 
a simple message when files differ.) 

       diff  -q  t1.txt   new_t1.txt  

If the files are different, the above command will produce
a message to that effect. If the files are identical, you won't
see any output; the Unix system will simply produce 
the prompt for the next command. 


II. Testing the program with the -s flag:
-----------------------------------------

(a) When you run the Unix command 

         p2  -s  t1.bin

    the output produced to stdout must be the following:

        Length of a shortest string in the input file  = 1
        Length of a longest string in the input file   = 5
        Value of the maximum integer in the input file = 100
        Value of the minimum integer in the input file = 96

(b) When you run the Unix command 

         p2  -s  t2.bin

    the output produced to stdout must be the following:

        Length of a shortest string in the input file  = 10
        Length of a longest string in the input file   = 100
        Value of the maximum integer in the input file = 100000
        Value of the minimum integer in the input file = 100

Note: After each call to the printf function, remember to
      use fflush(stdout) to ensure that the grading script will 
      see all the output written to stdout by your program.
